            <h1>A Kali Uchis Biography</h1>
            <div id="intro">
                    <p>Kali Uchis is a singer, songwriter, producer, as well as a video director. In 2012 Kali Uchis, otherwise known as <i>Karli-Marina Loaiza</i>, self-released her mixtape and within three years released one major album but made quite a few singles with major collaborations with famous artists. She is one of my favorite because she really puts her heart and soul into her work. </p>

                        <h2>One & Only Album</h2>
                        <p>The Only Album Kali Uchis studio released was <i>Isolation</i> back in 2018. Although she only has this one album I do not see how she can create music better than this. I believe this album currently only has two music video that was personally directed by the queen herself. The two videos would be:
                        <ul>
                            <li>After The Storm</li>
